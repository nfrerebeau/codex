## Overview

A collection of classes that represent archaeological data. This package provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix (absolute/relative frequency, presence/absence data, co-occurrence matrix, etc.) upon which package developers can build subclasses. It also provides a set of generic methods (mutators and coercion mechanisms) and functions (e.g. predicates). In addition, a few classes of general interest (e.g. that represent stratigraphic relationships) are implemented.

## Installation

You can install the released version of **arkhe** from [CRAN](https://CRAN.R-project.org) with:

```{r cran-installation, eval=FALSE}
install.packages("arkhe")
```

And the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

```{r gh-installation, eval=FALSE}
# install.packages("remotes")
remotes::install_github("tesselle/arkhe")
```

## Usage

```{r packages}
## Load the package
library(arkhe)
```

**arkhe** provides a set of S4 classes that represent different special types of matrix.

* Integer matrix:
    * `CountMatrix` represents absolute frequency data,
    * `OccurrenceMatrix` represents a co-occurrence matrix,
* Numeric matrix:
    * `CompositionMatrix` represents relative frequency (compositional) data,
* Logical matrix:
    * `IncidenceMatrix` represents presence/absence data,
    * `StratigraphicMatrix` represents stratigraphic relationships.

*It assumes that you keep your data tidy*: each variable (type/taxa) must be saved in its own column and each observation (assemblage/sample) must be saved in its own row.

These new classes are of simple use as they inherit from the base `matrix`:

```{r create}
## Define a count data matrix
## (data will be rounded to zero decimal places, then coerced with as.integer)
quanti <- CountMatrix(data = sample(0:10, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)

## Define a logical matrix
## (data will be coerced with as.logical)
quali <- IncidenceMatrix(data = sample(0:1, 100, TRUE), nrow = 10, ncol = 10)
```

**arkhe** uses coercing mechanisms (with validation methods) for data type conversions:

```{r coerce}
## Create a count matrix
X <- matrix(data = sample(0:10, 75, TRUE), nrow = 15, ncol = 5)

## Coerce to absolute frequencies
A1 <- as_count(X)

## Coerce to relative frequencies
B <- as_composition(A1)

## Row sums are internally stored before coercing to a frequency matrix
## (use get_totals() to get these values)
## This allows to restore the source data
A2 <- as_count(B)
all(A1 == A2)

## Coerce to presence/absence
D <- as_incidence(A1)

## Coerce to a co-occurrence matrix
E <- as_occurrence(A1)
```

The `CountMatrix`, `CompositionMatrix` and `IncidenceMatrix` classes have special slots:

* `samples` for replicated measurements/observation,
* `groups` to group data by site/area,
* `dates` to specify the date point estimate of an assemblage,
* `tqp` and `taq` to specify the chronology of an assemblage.

The way chronological information is handled is somewhat opinionated. Sub-annual precision is overkill/meaningless in most situations: dates are assumed to be expressed in years CE and are stored as integers (values are coerced with `as.integer()` and hence truncated towards zero).

When coercing a `data.frame` to a `*Matrix` object, an attempt is made to automatically assign values to these slots by mapping column names. This behavior can be disabled by setting `options(arkhe.autodetect = FALSE)`.

```{r group}
Y <- as.data.frame(X)
Y$samples <- sample(c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"), 15, TRUE)
Y$groups <- sample(c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E"), 15, TRUE)
Y$dates <- sample(1400:1451, 15, TRUE)
Y$tpq <- sample(1301:1400, 15, TRUE) # TPQ
Y$taq <- sample(1451:1500, 15, TRUE) # TAQ

## Coerce to a count matrix
Z <- as_count(Y)

## Get groups
get_samples(Z)

## Get groups
get_groups(Z)

## Get dates
get_dates(Z)

## Get chronology
get_terminus(Z)

## Summarize
summary(Z)
```
